## Description
This is a multiple-choice quiz application testing random knowledge. All questions are taken from the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/). This quiz app was made using a tutorial by [James Q Quick](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDlWc9AfQBfZIkdVaOQXi1tizJeNJipEx).

Users must answer 10 multiple-choice trivia questions within 60 seconds. Each correct answer is worth 10 points, while each incorrect answer incurs a 5 second time penalty. If the user is able to answer all 10 questions before time runs out, they will be allowed to record their score to be viewed on the High Scores page. However, only the user's 10 best scores will be recorded. 

This application uses just basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also fetches data from an __open-source API__ and stores user scores in __LocalStorage__.

The purpose of creating this app was to review basic JavaScript concepts, get some practice with __flex box__, and build knowledge on how to code out a basic game. My intention is to use what I learned through this tutorial in order to make my own quiz application, so keep an eye out!!
